# Notes
    1. Question: Is it possible to have multiple elements in return ?
    Ans: Yes, we can do it via the following method:

        <> 
            <div> </div> 
            <h1> </h1>
        </>` 
    OR    alternatively we can put all this inside a <div> as well as mentioned:
    `return 
        <div>
